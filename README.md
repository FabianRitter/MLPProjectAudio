# MLPProjectAudio
In this project we worked with the FSDnoisy18k database, see details of the database on: http://www.eduardofonseca.net/FSDnoisy18k/
This database has the purpose to investigate audio classification with noisy lables, by noisy label they meant that the labelling was not manually verified so there is uncertainty if they are correct or not.

In this project we worked in a CNN as a baseline with 5 layers and dropout. The details of the architecture and experiments can be seen in the Report folder.

We investigated the effect of different data augmentation techniques over this CNN baseline, particularly pitch and speed perturbation, and mix-up training.
